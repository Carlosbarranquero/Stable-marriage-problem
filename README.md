Algorithm to find a stable matching between two equally sized sets of elements given an ordering of preferences for each element

This is my implementation to solve the Stable Matching Problem proposed by David Gale and Lloyd Shapley. 
More information on the problem statement can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem.

Template: 
```python
set_A = {"element_a1":["first_preference_set_b", "second_preference_set_b", ...],
         "element_a2":["first_preference_set_b", "second_preference_set_b", ...],
          ...
set_B = {"element_b1":["first_preference_set_a", "second_preference_set_a", ...],
         "element_b2":["first_preference_set_a", "second_preference_set_a", ...],
          ...

```
